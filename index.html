      <p>Is the company stalling?</p>
      <p>We had what we wanted: your eyes</p>
      <p>(When we leave this room it's gone)</p>
      <p>With no word from the former</p>
      <p>I'd be happy as hell if you stayed for tea</p>
      <p>(I know so well that this is all there is)</p>
      <p>This is how we grow now, woman</p>
      <p>A child ignored</p>
      <p>These will just be places to me now</p>
      <p>The foreman is down</p>
      <p>(When we leave this room it's gone)</p>
      <p>We're rising the stairs</p>

      <p>Staying at the Ace Hotel, if the calm would allow</p>
      <p>Then I would just be floating to you now</p>
      <p>It would make me pass to let it pass on</p>
      <p>I'm climbing the dash, that skin</p>

    <figure>
      <p>Well we walked up on that bolt in the street</p>
      <p>After you tied me in in the driveway of the apartment of his bede</p>
      <p>Sent your sister home in a cab</p>
      <p>Said I would've walked across any thousand lands</p>
      <p>(No, not really if you can't)</p>
      <p>I didn't need you that night</p>
      <p>Not gonna need you anytime</p>
      <p>Was gonna take it as it goes</p>
      <p>I could go forward in the light</p>
      <p>Well I better fold my clothes</p>
